| **Key needed** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **Cost** | ~$0.003–0.008 per script (very cheap) |

---

### 2. ElevenLabs
| | |

### 3. fal.ai (Kling 2.5 Pro video generation)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Used for** | Generating cinematic 9:16 video clips from text prompts (Kling 2.5 Pro model) |
| **Sign up** | [fal.ai](https://fal.ai) |

### 4. NeonDB

|---|---|
| **Used for** | Database — stores topics queue, video history, all settings and secrets |
| **Sign up** | [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) |

| **Cost** | Free tier is sufficient for this app |
| **Free tier** | 0.5 GB storage, 1 project, unlimited requests |
| **Notes** | Connection string must include `?sslmode=require`. Schema lives in `shortgen` (not `public`). |

### 5. Cloudflare R2
| | |
|---|---|
| **Used for** | Storing the final assembled `.mp4` files |
| **Sign up** | [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com) — R2 is under your account |

| **Cost** | Free for the first 10 GB/month storage, first 1M Class A operations/month |

| **Keys needed** | `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN` |
| **Cost** | Free (YouTube API has a quota system, not a billing system) |
| **Daily quota** | 10,000 units/day. One video upload = ~1,600 units. So ~6 uploads/day free. |
| **Important** | The refresh token must be obtained via the `scripts/get_youtube_token.py` helper. It does not expire unless you revoke it. |
| **Notes** | The app uploads with `made_for_kids=false` by default. Change in Settings if needed. |

## Cost Per Video — Summary

| Service | Cost per video | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Kling 2.5 Pro (fal.ai) | ~$4.20 | 3 clips × $1.40 (dominant cost) |
| ElevenLabs | ~$0.30–0.50 | Depends on script length |
| Claude | ~$0.005–0.01 | Very cheap |
| R2 storage | ~$0.001 | Negligible |
| **Total** | **~$4.50–5.00** | Per published Short |

Reduce `max_clips` to `1` or `2` in Settings to cut costs:
- 1 clip: ~$1.80 total
- 2 clips: ~$3.20 total
- 3 clips: ~$4.60 total (recommended quality)

## Account Quotas to Watch

| Service | Limit | What happens if exceeded |
|---------|-------|------------------------|
| YouTube API | 10,000 units/day | Upload fails with quota error |
| GitHub Actions (private repo) | 500 min/month | Workflow stops running |
| ElevenLabs free tier | 10,000 chars/month | Audio generation fails |
| NeonDB free tier | 0.5 GB | DB writes start failing |

All of these are generous enough that a single user running 1 video/day will never hit them.
